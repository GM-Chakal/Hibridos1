                        Many of the uses of a deck of cards are well known to everyone. After all, playing cards have been used for centuries in order to play card games, and perform card magic. But what exactly is this new kid on the block, that goes under the name "cardistry", is wearing out many an old deck, and is having brand new decks designed especially for its use?

                        To whet your appetite, if you really do not know anything about cardistry at all, I would suggest that you start by checking out the following four-minute video clip. It already has more than 2 million views due to its popularity, and you will soon understand why when you see the cardistry highlights featured here.

                        Cardistry can best be defined as "the performance art of card flourishing". It is what happens when you take traditional playing cards to the next level - literally! It is about spinning them, tossing them, cutting them, and otherwise manipulating them - up, down, sideways, and around, and however else you can - in order to create an aesthetically pleasing display.

                        The Virtuoso deck made history in 2012 as the first deck ever designed for Cardistry, and remains today as the choice of top Cardists around the globe. Today, Cardistry is thriving more than ever. Still, we are only getting started.
